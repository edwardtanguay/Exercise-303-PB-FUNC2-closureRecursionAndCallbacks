# Closure, Recursion and Callbacks

Closure, Recursion and Callbacks are three concepts that are quite important in advanced JavaScript. This exercise allows you to demonstrate that you understand the basics of these three concepts.

## 1. Closure

### 1.1. Closure Countdown

- Create a function with closure which will count down a number from 5 to 1 by calling the following code:

```
console.log(subtract());
console.log(subtract());
console.log(subtract());
console.log(subtract());
console.log(subtract());
```


## 2. Recursion

- nnn

## 3. Callbacks

- nnn
